            <h1>WELCOME TO BURGER HOUSE</h1>
            <p>
            Back in 1954, a man named Nikunj Singh discovered a small burger restaurant in Mumbai, and wrote the first page of our history. From humble beginnings as a small restaurant, we're proud to have become one of the world's leading food service brands with more than 36,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.
